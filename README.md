# Methods that might bring about improvement
1. instead of using one frame per branch, use 2.5D per branch  
2. replace the DeepLabV3 architecture with Unet or other lighter structures
3. recode the validation phase using the method in paper or code
4. use mean teacher semi-supervised method to ultilize the consistency between frames 
5. use self-supervised setting as pretraining
